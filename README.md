# Face-Recognition
Face detection and identity recognition project.


Face Recognition project has the capabilities of detecting a face and saving some meta data simultaneously with it.
Again, when the face is detected and it matches the earlier saved face then it displays the meta data of that face. Meta data may mean the name or a unique number associated with the person. 
This project also contains two python files, a data directory containing the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml pretrained classifier file, an ImagesUnknown directory in which all the unidentified face images are saved, TrainingImage directory contains all the face images which are used to train the detection model, TrainingImageLabel contains the trained trainer.yml trained model, and UserDetails directory contains a csv file having all the metadata saved.
